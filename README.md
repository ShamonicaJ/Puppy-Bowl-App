# Puppy-Bowl-AppBased on Calliope's email:

You are working with the humane society to add a mini-game to their website
The game should allow visitors to create teams of puppies to compete in a "puppy bowl"
Someone has already built out the API and some of the front-end
Work with your team to plan and implement using GitHub Project 
You will be provided with the GitHub link to any existing work that has been done 
Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end! The front-end should allow the user to: 

view the roster
see a player's details
add players to the roster
...and more!
All the data you need is available through the API â€“ your job is to leverage it!

ðŸ““ Pro Tip: As you work, record the knowledge and skills you are using for this project in your journal. That way, when you show-and-tell it to future employers, you can highlight the skills this project demonstrates!
